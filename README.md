# QuotasManager

Micro-work for Software Systems of Development at Minho University.

The objectives of the work is to be familiar with Swing and recap Java language.

In a few words the work is to build a tiny app with interface that shows members of one Association.

Features already working:
- Add new members;
- Pay quotas;
- Change data of members.

Features to add:
- Remove members;
- Save the current status;
- Load a saved status.

I'm using Netbeans to be more easy to build app interfaces.
